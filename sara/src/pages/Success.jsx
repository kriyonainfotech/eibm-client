                    <p>
                      Satish who was not already interested in teaching but went
                      to study out of fear of his father and because of society
                      but his mind never felt in the books. He has inherited the
                      rites of helping others from his mother and fearlessness
                      from his father. It often seems that even God tests such
                      people, robbing them of their mother‚Äôs happiness at an
                      early age. Whenever such an incident took place, even a
                      person with a rock-like mind would fall, but Satish did
                      not lose courage and did not allow anyone else to lose
                      courage.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Not only was he interested in teaching but he was also
                      under pressure from his family. He had taken admitted in
                      civil but he was a direct student !! Despite taking
                      admission in civil, he used to go and sit in mechanical
                      class. It is said that something similar happened to
                      Satish. He failed in civil because of his teaching by
                      Param, so the family members were very upset with him.
                      Listening to him a lot, forcing him to do something
                      because the family also has some expectations from him
                      when the boy is old enough. But Satish had a different
                      tune in his mind and he wanted to do something new.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      For this, he had no one from his family to support him.
                      Naturally, if you don‚Äôt even have two rupees in your
                      pocket and you are talking about lakhs, will anyone
                      believe it?? His dreams with Satish were high but he did
                      not have anything special with which he could make a fresh
                      start. However, he did not lose heart and continued his
                      hard work. But it is said that good men have to travel a
                      lot. Satish started his career and there he had a terrible
                      accident. An accident that made everyone talk, this person
                      may not be able to stand on his own. But Satish loses his
                      courage!!! He also beat death and got out of bed in just
                      two months Then a new Satish was born and now this Satish
                      could not be stopped by anyone.
